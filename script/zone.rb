1. create new zone "Asia"
2. add country "Japan"
3. in config > states, pick "Japan" and add state "Kanto"
4. And of course, I added a new Shipping Method for Asia zone. { name -> Japan (JPY) {you have to specify the currency in the brackets :) & it has to be the same as in the field "CURRENCY:" & if it's not USD you have to change it in "GENERAL SETTINGS" by choosing currency in "CHOOSE CURRENCY"} }

Shipping method without choosing any shipping category. "SHIPPING CATEGORY" --> None.
